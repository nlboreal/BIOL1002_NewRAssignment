**Remember!** The [*Quantitative Skills for Biology*](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/) manual you used in BIOL 1001 is still online (and updated regularly). If you need to review how to install and use R, please the manual! You can access it here: <https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/>.

When using R, you have many ways to get [help](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/help.html).

In addition, these labs are based on *Week 3: Data in Tables* (PART I) and *Week 4: Grouping & Joining Data* (PART II) of the online course [Data Carpentry for Biologists](https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/schedule/) by Dr. Ethan White. If you are not sure how to execute a particular command, you can refer to the *Lecture* material on [Dr. White's website](https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/lectures/R-data/)</u> and/or his [instructional videos](https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/lectures/R-data/) that go with the relevant lessons. The example data in the lecture material and videos is different from the data you use in the exercise.

**After these labs you should be able to:**

-   install packages and load data,
-   understand the data manipulation functions of `dplyr`,
-   and execute a simple import and data filter scenario

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# PART I: Managing biological data

**TO HAND-IN** You are to hand in a `.R` file, formatted as shown in [Best Practices - Template](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/style.html#template) where the lines of code to produce the output asked for under **HAND-IN** are produced in the order they are asked for.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assignment Overview

Newfoundland has one of the highest moose densities in North America, despite moose being **invasive** to the island. Since their introduction in the early 20th century, moose populations have grown rapidly and now play a significant role in shaping Newfoundland's ecosystems and its people.

The goal of this R coding assignment is to introduce students on to how to manage biological datasets.

In this assignment, you will work with mostly fictional datasets to explore how changes in moose populations over **time** and **spatially** have affected:

1\. **Local biodiversity**: Through moose tree sapling browsing preferences

2\. **Human communities**: Through human-moose vehicle collisions.

## Dataset Overview

You will be working two different datasets.

1\. `MoosePopulation.csv`

2\. `SaplingStudy.csv`

You must download these datasets before beginning this assignment. You can download them from Brightspace: You can also access these data from [here](https://github.com/jbaafi/quant-guide-data/tree/main/BIOL1002-data). Then, save all .csv files to an appropriate folder (Ex. BIOL1002_Coding).

## Part One: Moose Populations in Newfoundland

**Question 1:**\
[Instal](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/rintro.html#r-packages) the `dplyr` package using `install.packages()` function. You only need to do this once.\
Then, use the `library()` function to load `dplyr` so that its functions are available to use.

```{r}
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

```

**Question 2:** read.csv()\
Next [import](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/data-entry.html#loading-or-importing-data) the `MoosePopulation.csv` dataset. You may call your dataset `Moosedata` or give it a different name. If you use the programmatic way (i.e., command line), your command may look something like this:

```{r}
Moosedata <- read.csv("./MoosePopulation.csv")
```

**Question 3:**\
Take a moment to look through the data you just imported by using `View()` function. You might notice that some cells are empty or “NA” — these are missing values. When dealing with large biological datasets, it’s common to start by removing missing data.\

Write a line of code where you use `na.omit()` to remove rows with missing values. **Remember to save** your dataset with the cleaned version with a new name (or overwrite the old one).

```{r}
Moosedata <- na.omit(Moosedata)
```

**Question 4**:\
Next, let's simplify the dataset to only include the columns of interest. Add a line of code where you use the [`select()`](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/handling-data.html#selecting-a-column) function to select the following columns: `Ecoregion`, `Year`, `Area`, `Estimated_Moose_Pop`.

**Remember to save** your dataset with the cleaned version with a new name (or overwrite the old one).

```{r}
Moosedata <- select(Moosedata, Ecoregion, Year, Area, Estimated_Moose_Pop)

```

**Question 5:**\
a. What is the oldest observation in the dataset? Add a line where you use the `min()` function to find the oldest `Year`. Then write your answer as a comment `#`.

```{r}
min(Moosedata$Year)
#Answer 1904
```

b.  Use the `max()` function to what is the highest 'Estimated_Moose_Pop' was recorded? Then write your answer as a comment `#`. Is this number for a particular ecoregion or for all of Newfoundland?

```{r}
max(Moosedata$Estimated_Moose_Pop) 
#Answer 41250 for the Central_Forests

```

**Question 6:**\
Different ecoregions cover different land areas, so comparing raw population numbers isn’t very helpful. Standardize your data by calculating moose density for each ecoregion. Using the [`mutate()`](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/handling-data.html#adding-a-new-column) function, create a new column called `MooseDensity`. Remember density is equal to population divided by area.

```{r}
Moosedata <- mutate(Moosedata, MooseDensity = Estimated_Moose_Pop / Area)

```

**Question 7** plot()\
a. Now, let's visualize the data. Using the [`plot()`](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/graph.html#scatter-plots-with-plotxy) function, make a line graph to show the the changes in `MooseDensity` over `Year`. Full marks for including axis labels and figure title ( `xlab` , `ylab` , `main`).

```{r}
plot(Moosedata$Year, Moosedata$MooseDensity,
     xlab = "Year",
     ylab = "Moose Density",
     main = "Moose Density over time")
```

**Question 8:**\
The research team were particularly interested in how moose populations have changed over time in the Western Forests.\
a) Create a new dataset, where you use the [`filter()`](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/handling-data.html#filtering-data) function to only include observations from the `Western_Forests` ecoregion.

```{r}
MooseData_5 <- Moosedata %>% 
  filter(Ecoregion == "Western_Forests")

```

\
b) Use the `plot()` function to make a [line graph](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/graph.html#line-graphs) (`type = "l"`) showing how moose density has changed over time in Western_Forests region. Full marks for including axis labels and figure title ( `xlab` , `ylab` , `main`).

```{r}
plot(MooseData_5$Year, MooseData_5$MooseDensity,
     type = "l",
     xlab = "Year",                
     ylab = "Moose Density",       
     main = "Moose Density Over Time in Western Forests")

```

**Question 9:**\
The research team was interested in trends for all ecoregions for just recent years.   a) Using the **original, unfiltered dataset you created in Question 6**, use the [`filter()`](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/handling-data.html#filtering-data) function to filter for the year `2020`, and save the dataset under a new name (Ex. MooseData_2020).\

```{r}
MooseData_2020 <- filter(Moosedata, Year == 2020)

```

b)  The research team considered moose densities above 2.0 moose/km² to be high. Using the dataset you just created, `filter()` the `MooseDensity` to only show ecoregions where moose density is greater than 2.0. Remember to save the dataset under a new name (Ex. MooseData_2020_b).\

```{r}
MooseData_2020_b <- filter(MooseData_2020, MooseDensity > 2.0)

```

c)  With the dataset you just created, use the [`arrange()`](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/handling-data.html#sorting-the-data) function to sort the `MooseDensity` column in descending order. Template: `arrange(Dataset, desc(ColumnName))`

```{r}
arrange(MooseData_2020_b, desc(MooseDensity))
```

**Question 10:**\
Pipes `%>%` allow you to connect one line of code to the next, so you don't have to save the dataset under a new name for each step.\
Repeat the steps from the previous question using a pipe at the end of each line. Using your inital dataset, `filter()` for the year `2020`, then `filter()` for `MooseDensity` above `2.0`, then `arrange()` in `desc()` order, then finally `print()` the output.

```{r}
Moosedata4 <- Moosedata %>% 
  filter(Year == 2020) %>% 
  filter(MooseDensity > 2.0) %>% 
  arrange(desc(MooseDensity)) %>% 
  print()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part Two: Tree Sapling Study

In this section we will be working with the `SaplingStudy` dataset.\

**Dataset Overview:** A team of researchers at MUN went to each ecoregion and sampled all the different tree saplings that grew that year. The goal of this study was to see if moose have browsing preference on sapling species. For each tree they recorded

-   The height of the tree (cm)

-   The moose browsing intensity: With 0 being no browsing by moose and 5 meaning severe browsing.\

**Question 11**\
a. [Load](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/data-entry.html#loading-or-importing-data) the data file: `SaplingStudy.csv` and save your dataset to a name (Ex. Saplings).

b)  Then remove the `NA`s from the dataset using `na.omit()` function. Remember to save the cleaned version of your dataset to a new name (or override the old name).

```{r}
# Saplings <- read_csv(
#   file = "../biol-1002-moose/SaplingStudy.csv")

Saplings <- read.csv("SaplingStudy.csv")
Saplings <- na.omit(Saplings)

```

**Question 12**\
a) How does moose browsing pressure vary across different ecoregions? With the help of [pipes](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/handling-data.html#pipes) `%>%`, create a new use the [`group_by()`](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/handling-data.html#grouping) function to group the data by `Ecoregion`, and then use `summarize()` to calculate the `mean()` moose `BrowsingScore` for each site.

```{r}
AvgBrowsing <- Saplings %>%
  group_by(Ecoregion) %>%
  summarise(AverageBrowsing = mean(BrowsingScore)) %>%
  print()

```

b)  Add a comment `#` saying which ecoregion has the most moose browsing. Which ecoregion has the lowest?

```{r}
# StraitOfBelleIsleBarrens has the lowest browsing score
# Northern_Peninsula_Forests has the highest browsing score 

```

**Question 13**\
a) How does the average tree height vary across different ecoregions? With the help of [pipes](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/handling-data.html#pipes) `%>%`, use the `group_by` function to group the data by `Ecoregion`, and then use `summarize()` to calculate the `mean()` tree `Height` for each group.

```{r}
AvgHeight <- Saplings %>% 
  group_by(Ecoregion) %>% 
  summarise(AvgHeight = mean(Height)) %>% 
  print()
```

b)  The team considered average heights less than 20cm to be severely browsed by moose. Add a short comment `#` with which ecoregions have average heights less than 20. Do this by looking at your data or using a filter().

```{r}
#	Western_Forests and Northern_Peninsula_Forests have average heights less than 20cm

```

**Question 14**\
a) How does the average browsing score vary across different tree sapling species? Use the `group_by` function to group the data by `Species`, and then use `summarize() to`calculate the `mean` tree `BrowsingScore` for each group.

```{r}
AverageBrowsing <- Saplings %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarise(AverageBrowsing = mean(BrowsingScore)) %>% 
  print()
```

b)  Add a comment `#` saying which species has the highest browsing score, which species has the lowest?

```{r}
# Black spruce has the lowest browsing score
# Black ash has the highest browsing score
```

**Question 15** 

A team of researchers in interested in how Balsam Fir browsing intensity varies by ecoregion. With the help of pipes, use the `filter()` function to filter the `Species` column for only `Balsam_Fir`, then use `group_by()` function to sort by `Ecoregion` , and then determine `mean()` moose `BrowsingScore`. Remember to save the resulting summary table under a new name (Ex.BalsamFir).

```{r}
BalsamFir<- Saplings %>% 
  filter(Species == "Balsam_Fir") %>% 
  group_by(Ecoregion) %>%
  summarise(AvgBrowsingScore = mean(BrowsingScore)) %>%
  print()
```

**Question 16:**\
Using the `BalsamFir` dataset you created in Question 15, make a bar graph the `barplot()` function. Each bar should represent an ecoregion, and the height of the bar should reflect the average browsing intensity. Follow the template below and replace the placeholder names with the appropriate column names from your dataset

#```{r}
#barplot(Dataset$YAxisColumn, 
        names.arg = Dataset$XAxisColumn,
        xlab = "X-axis name goes here",
        ylab = "Y-axis name goes here",
        main = "Figure title goes here",
        col = "forestgreen",  #pick any colour you want
        cex.names = 0.6)  # Reduce x-axis label size for readability
```

```{r}
barplot(BalsamFir$AvgBrowsingScore,
        names.arg = BalsamFir$Ecoregion,
        xlab = "Ecoregion",
        ylab = "Average Browsing Score",
        main = "Balsam Fir Browsing Intensity by Ecoregion",
        col = "forestgreen",
        cex.names = 0.6) 

```

**Question 17:**

How does Black_Spruce browsing intensity varies by ecoregion? Repeat the steps from question 15 and 16 but now with Black_Spruce.

a)  With the help of pipes, use the `filter()` function to filter the `Species` column for only `Black_Spruce`, then use `group_by()` function to sort by `Ecoregion` , and then determine `mean()` moose `BrowsingScore`. Remember to save the resulting summary table under a new name (Ex.Black_Spruce).

```{r}
Black_Spruce <- Saplings %>% 
  filter(Species == "Black_Spruce") %>% 
  group_by(Ecoregion) %>%
  summarise(AvgBrowsingScore = mean(BrowsingScore)) %>%
  print()

```

b)  Using the dataset you just created, make a bar graph the `barplot()` function to show the Average browsing score for Black Spruce across the ecoregions. Each bar should represent an ecoregion, and the height of the bar should reflect the average browsing intensity

```{r}
barplot(Black_Spruce$AvgBrowsingScore,
        names.arg = Black_Spruce$Ecoregion,
        xlab = "Ecoregion",
        ylab = "Average Browsing Score",
        main = "Balsam Fir Browsing Intensity by Ecoregion",
        col = "forestgreen",
        cex.names = 0.6) 
```

c)  How does Black Spruce browsing compare to Balsam Fir browsing across ecoregions? Write 1-2 sentences as a comment `#` with your answer.

```{r}
# Balsam Fir browsing pressure is high across all ecoregions
# Black_Spruce browsing pressure is only high in a few ecoregions

```

**Question 18:**\
Were the same number of tree saplings counted in each Ecoregion?\
Add a line of code where you use the `group_by()` function and the `tally()` function to determine how many trees were counted in each `Ecoregion`?

```{r}
EcoregionTally<- SaplingData %>%
  group_by(Ecoregion) %>%
  tally() %>% 
  print()

```

**Question 19:**\
Were the same number of saplings counted for each species? Add a line of code where you use the `tally()` function to determine how many individual trees were counted in for each `Species`?

```{r}
EcoregionTally<- SaplingData %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  tally() %>% 
  print()
```

**Question 20**\
In any ecological study, it’s important to ask whether the dataset accurately reflects the system you’re trying to understand. In this question, you’ll evaluate whether sampling bias may be affecting your interpretation of moose browsing patterns.

a\. Add a short comment \# saying if you think the `SaplingStudy` dataset is evenly distributed. Are any ecoregion(s) or tree species overrepresented, are any underepresented in the dataset.

```{r}
# In terms of ecoregions, data is not evenly distributed 
# Northern_Peninsula_Forests is over represented. 
# StraitOfBelleIsleBarrens is under represented.

# In terms of tree species, data is not evenly distributed 
# Balsam_Fir is over represented. 
# Black ash is under represented.
```

b\. Why is it important to recognize bias in ecological datasets. Write 1-2 sentences as a comment `#` with your answer.

```{r}
# It’s important to recognize bias in ecological datasets because 
# uneven sampling can lead to misleading conclusions.

```

## Part Three: Creating and Joining Datasets

Moose density and browsing preferences

The team of researchers we curious if moose browsing preferences changed depending on moose density. They hypothesized that at

-   **At low moose densities:** browsing would be selective, with moose favoring the most palatable tree species.

-   **At high moose densities:** Would have high competition, and browsing pressure would become less selective, with moose consuming all sapling species more uniformly.\

In this section, we will merge the `Moosedata`and the `Sapling` datasets, to explore how browsing intensity on different tree species correlates with moose density across ecoregions. You will practice using the left_join() function to combine these dataset

**Question 1**\
a) Using the orginal `Moosedata` dataset, `filter()` function to select only the rows for the year `2020`. Then create a new column called `MooseDensity` using the `mutate()` fucntion. Save the dataset under a new name called `MooseData_2020`. (Hint: you previously did this for question 9)\
b) Use `left_join()` to join `MooseData2020` with the `Saplings` dataset, matching rows by the common `Ecoregion` column.

```{r}
SaplingMoose <- Saplings %>%
  left_join(MooseData_2020, by = "Ecoregion")
```

**Question 2**

Using the dataset you just created, calculate the average browsing score and average moose density for each species within each ecoregion, save your dataset under the name `BrowsingBySpeciesDensity`.\
With the help of pipes `%>%` , `group_by` `Species` and `Ecoregion`, then use `summarize()` to find the `mean()` `BrowsingScore`, and then find the `mean()` `MooseDensity` .

```{r}
BrowsingBySpeciesDensity <- SaplingMoose %>%
group_by(Species, Ecoregion) %>%
  summarise(AvgBrowsingSpp = mean(BrowsingScore),
            AvgDensity = mean(MooseDensity))
```

**Question 3**\
The research team created the following figure to help visualize how average browsing intensity on different tree species changes with moose density across ecoregions. The graph uses the `ggplot2` package, which is beyond the scope of this assignment. However, you can copy and paste the code below into your R console to explore the plot.

```{r BorwsingIntensitySpecies_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

ggplot(BrowsingBySpeciesDensity, aes(x = AvgDensity, y = AvgBrowsing, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Browsing Intensity Across Moose Density by Species",
       x = "Average Moose Density",
       y = "Average Browsing Score")
```

Based on the figure, answer the following questions using 1-2 sentences.

a)  Is there evidence that supports the researchers' hypothesis? Do moose show strong preferences at low density and shift to more generalist browsing at higher density? Add a short comment (1-2 sentences) with your answer.

```{r}
# Yes, as avergae moose density increases, so does average browsing score
```

b)  Which sapling specie(s) do moose favour the most? Which do they browse the least? Add a short comment (1-2 sentences) with your answer.

```{r}
# From the figure, moose show stronger preferences for Willow and Alder
# Moose show low preference for Black spruce
```

c)  Which sapling species is not shown on the figure and why? Add a short comment (1-2 sentences) with your answer.

```{r}
# Black Ash is not shown
# Only one individual observation in the dataset, which is insufficient for displaying a trend 
```

### Moose-vehicle collisions

As moose populations expanded across Newfoundland in the 20th century, so did the frequency of moose-vehicle collisions. These incidents pose serious risks to both humans and wildlife, especially in regions where roads intersect key moose habitat.\

In this section, you'll explore a simplified dataset containing the number of recorded moose-vehicle collisions per ecoregion in 2020. Your goal is to investigate whether moose density in an ecoregion can help explain collision patterns.

**Question 4**\
Copy and paste each vector, then run them so they appear under your Values section in the Envionment.

Then add a line of code where you use the `data.frame()` function, create a table using your vectors called `MooseCollisions`.

```{r}
Collisions_2020 <- c(56, 60, 14, 36, 48, 10, 40, 110, 6)
HumanPopulation <- c(18000, 12000, 4000, 75100, 24000,3500, 32000, 270000,    2300)
StudySites <- c("North_Shore_Forests","Northern_Peninsula_Forests", "Long_Range_Barrens","Central_Forests","Western_Forests","EasternHyperOceanicBarrens","Maritime_Barrens","Avalon_Forests","StraitOfBelleIsleBarrens")
               
MooseCollisions <- data.frame(StudySites, Collisions_2020, HumanPopulation)
```

**Question 5** left\_\
a) Now let's join this dataset with Moosedata filtered for just the year 2020. Try to use `left_join()` to join them. Why does this not work?

```{r}
# Have no common variables, 
# columns called Ecoregion vs. StudySites

```

b)  Use the `rename()` function, to change the column name of one of the datasets to match the other, so that they can be joined. Template: rename(NewName = OldName)

```{r}
MooseCollisions <- MooseCollisions %>% 
  rename(Ecoregion = StudySites)
```

c)  Now join the datasets

```{r}
MooseMerged <- MooseData_2020 %>%
  left_join(MooseCollisions, by = "Ecoregion")
```

**Question 6**\
a) How does moose density relate to the number of moose-vehicle collisions? Use the `plot()` function to create a scatterplot of `MooseDensity` and `Collisions_2020`

```{r}
plot(MooseMerged$MooseDensity, MooseMerged$Collisions_2020,
     xlab = "Moose Density",
     ylab = "Collisions in 2020",
     main = "Moose Density vs Moose-Vehicle Collisions")
```

b)  What trends do you see? Are there any outliers?

```{r}
# As Moose density increases, so does collisions 
# Avalon Peninsula is an outlier, because it has the highest population of people 
```

**Question 7**\
Which ecoregions have the highest number of moose collisions per person? Create a new column called `CollisionsPerCapita` that is equal to `Collisions_2020` divided by `HumanPopulation`

```{r}
MooseMerged <- MooseMerged %>%
  mutate(CollisionsPerCapita = Collisions_2020 / HumanPopulation)

```

**Question 8**\
While regions with large human populations may have more total moose collisions, it's important to ask: Who is most at risk, individually? A useful way to explore this is by plotting collisions per capita against total human population.

a)  Use the `plot()` function to create a scatterplot of `CollisionsPerCapita` versus `HumanPopulation`

```{r}
plot(MooseMerged$HumanPopulation, MooseMerged$CollisionsPerCapita,
     xlab = "Human Population",
     ylab = "Collisions per Person",
     main = "Collisions per Capita vs Population Size",
     pch = 19,
     col = "purple")

```

**Question 9**\
Write 1-2 sentences describing what trends you see. Does this trend make sense based on what you know about moose and human populations in Newfoundland?

```{r}
#Rural populations have a righer risk of collisions per person
#This makes sense, more moose in rural areas with less people, higher indivudal chance
```

**Question 10** Optional This is a new version of the BIOL 1002 R assignment and we are interested in your feedback. The goal of this assignment is to introduce students to what its like dealing with large biolgical datasets and coding in R Studio with the dpylr package. Please leave a short comment what you liked, what you didn't like or how you think it could be improved.
